## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges allow you to improve your skills in a real-life workflow.

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and a tiny bit of JavaScript.**

## What I learned with this Challenge?
I made this challenge Mobile First and it was nice and easy to manage the media queries. And also combine **CSS grids with flexbox**. On **JavaScript**, I added some interactive actions on the share button to show some options on the website view and hide some elements on the mobile view.
